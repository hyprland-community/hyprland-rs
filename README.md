An unofficial rust wrapper for Hyprland's IPC

## Disclaimer
If something doesn't work, doesn't matter what,
make sure you are on the latest commit of Hyprland before making an issue!

## Getting started!

Let's get started with Hyprland-rs!

### Adding to your project

Add the code below to the dependencies section of your Cargo.toml file!

```toml
hyprland = "0.3.3"
```

#### Master version
If Hyprland-rs is broken (or other reason) and is taking too long for a release to come out,
you can use the master branch in Cargo (will not allow the crate to be published to `crates.io`):

```toml
hyprland = { git = "https://github.com/hyprland-community/hyprland-rs", branch = "master" }
```

### What this crate provides

This crate provides 6 modules (+1 for shared things)
 - `data` for getting information on the compositor
 - `event_listener` which provides the `EventListener` struct for listening for events
 - `dispatch` for calling dispatchers
 - `keyword` for dealing with config option (aka keywords)
 - `config::binds` for changing binds (in future `config` might have config generation)
 - `ctl` for calling hyprctl commands

## Example Usage

Check the examples in the [`src/bin/` directory](https://github.com/hyprland-community/hyprland-rs/tree/master/examples)
